Arrays:
Array is collections of similardatatypes

properties:
1.fix the Array size
2.We can not increse the Array size at run time
3.Array starting from 0

int a=10;
int b=1;
int c=4;
int d=6;

int[] number={1,2,3,4,5,6};
starting index 0--->5

number[0]=1;
number[1]=2;
number[2]=3;
number[3]=4;
number[4]=5;
number[5]=6;


Array types:
1.Single Dimensional
2.MultiDimensional (or)Two Dimensional

how to Declare an Array?

int[] number={1,2,3,4,5,6};

using new keyword:
String[] name=new String[5];


int[] numbers={12,15,16,11,14};

int[] number={10,50,40,20,30};
output --50,40,30,20,10

PrintDuplicate:
int[] num={1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3};

for(int i=0;i<num.length;i++){
for(int j=i+1;j<num.length;j++){


String:

String text="TestLeaf";

using new keyword:
String name=new String("TestLeaf);

1
=> Fibonacci Series
=> Print even number between 1 to 15
2
=> Swaping between two numbers(with or without temporary variable)
=> Factorial
3
=> Primenumber
=> convert a given number into negative
